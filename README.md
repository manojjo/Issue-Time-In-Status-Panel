## The Problem It Solves

Jira doesn’t provide an easy way to track how long an issue spends in each status, requiring users to sift through history logs. Issue Status Insight solves this by showing all status transitions in one place, automatically calculating time spent in each status, and offering an aggregated view of total time. While Board Insights focuses on stuck issues and provides broader reporting solutions, Issue Status Insight zooms in on individual issues, offering quick, detailed status insights directly at the issue level without needing to navigate to higher-level reports.

2. Once installed, the **Issue Status Insight** panel will appear on the right side of Jira issue views.
